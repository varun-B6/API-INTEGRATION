##This task involves creating a responsive weather web application that retrieves and displays current weather information for any city input by the user dynamically. The application utilizes the public API provided by wttr.in, which provides weather information in JSON format with no API key or user authentication required. This makes it suitable for learning and beginners.

The primary goal of this assignment is to show the capacity to work with a public API using core web technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—and create an interface that is responsive and user-friendly on devices. The user has the option to input the name of a city, and upon button click, the application retrieves real-time weather information like temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed.

The application utilizes HTML to define the page elements like input field, button, and weather display area. CSS is applied for styling a clean, mobile-friendly layout. Media queries guarantee responsiveness so that the application can be used on desktop, tablet, and smartphone devices. JavaScript is responsible for API requesting and DOM manipulating. When the user enters the name of a city, the script makes a request for https://wttr.in/?format=j1.

The JSON result is interpreted and relevant weather data are extracted and displayed on the webpage.

This method of API consumption assists developers in acquiring important JavaScript concepts such as fetch(), async/await, error management, and dynamic content updates. Most other weather APIs demand an API key or even user registration, which wttr.in avoids, making it extremely easy to implement and incorporate into rapid development and testing.

The software environment utilized is the client-side web browser, i.e., the application is executed completely on the user's machine without the necessity for server-side computation or databases. Consequently, this project is light and simple to deploy. It may be hosted on any static website hosting service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or even executed from a file directly on a local machine. The application possesses various applications in the real world. It can be utilized as a basic tool to verify current weather data in any city, so it is helpful for personal usage, school demos, or public kiosks. For beginners and students, it is a good practical example of API work and creation of responsive interfaces. With slight improvements such as geolocation, icons, or extended multi-day forecasts, it can be a more feature-rich weather solution.

It can also be integrated into trip sites, dashboards, or home automation interfaces as a weather widget.Overall, this weather web app illustrates the way to create a dynamic and flexible web interface with merely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while making use of a free and open public API. It highlights real-world web development capability and can be developed further into more sophisticated projects with more features.
